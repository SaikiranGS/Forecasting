# Forecasting
The purpose of this project is to check for time series stationarity and forecasting across "Airpassengers" and "daily-minimum temperature in melbourne" (kaggle) datasets 

# Description about files
  1. timeseries_stationarity.ipynb : To check the time series stationarity and convert the non stationary series to stationary. This is done by performing the time series decomposition to calculate the trend, seasonality and noise components. We also check for null hypothesis.  
  2. Forecast_using_Arima.ipynb : To forecast the series predictions using arima model on both the datasets.
